# HeartBeat AI - Cardiac Sound Abnormality Detection

Comprehensive ML pipeline for detecting cardiac and respiratory anomalies from auscultation audio. Implementation is proceeding in clearly defined stages—Stages **1** (scaffolding) and **2** (signal preprocessing + model architectures) are now complete.

## Stage Plan
1. ✅ Project scaffolding & configs
2. ✅ Audio preprocessing module + ensemble model definitions
3. ✅ Training/evaluation scripts + EDA notebook scaffold
4. ✅ Prediction, explainability, FastAPI backend
5. ✅ Streamlit clinical dashboard
6. ⏳ Docker, load testing, deployment, documentation

Stay tuned for incremental updates per stage.
